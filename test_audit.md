# Test Suite Audit Plan

This document is a working plan + checklist for reviewing Egregoros’ test suite.

Goals:
- Ensure tests verify the **behaviors we actually care about** (security/privacy invariants, federation correctness, Mastodon/Pleroma API compatibility, UI correctness).
- Reduce **brittleness** (tests that fail for incidental HTML changes, timing, global config, or process ordering).
- Reduce **uneconomical tests** (slow integration tests where a smaller unit test would suffice).
- Identify and fill **coverage gaps** in critical areas (authz, privacy/DMs, signature verification, ingestion, delivery).

Non-goals:
- Chasing arbitrary “100% coverage”.
- Rewriting tests purely for style if they’re already stable and meaningful.

## Baseline (current state)

- `mix test --cover` (2026-01-12): `1345` tests, `0` failures, **85.01%** total coverage (threshold `85%`).
- “Smell” checks:
  - No `Process.sleep/1` / `:timer.sleep/1` occurrences in `test/`.
  - No `Application.put_env/delete_env` occurrences in `test/`.
- Lowest-coverage modules worth targeting early (high ROI for coverage gate):
  - `EgregorosWeb.ErrorHTML` (50% — generated code; low ROI unless needed)
  - `Egregoros.Release` (~55%)
  - `EgregorosWeb.E2EEController` (~66%)
  - `Egregoros.Federation.ActorDiscovery` (~66%)
- Known test-suite noise:
  - Occasional `Postgrex.Protocol disconnected` log spam during suite/precommit runs (likely a process escaping the SQL sandbox owner lifetime).

## Review Criteria (per test / per file)

For each test file, answer:
1. **Intent:** What user-facing or security-critical behavior is this validating?
2. **Signal:** Does it fail for the right reasons? (Good assertions, not incidental output.)
3. **Determinism:** Does it avoid time dependence, global env changes, ordering dependence?
4. **Scope:** Is the level (unit vs integration vs LiveView) appropriate?
5. **Redundancy:** Is it duplicating coverage elsewhere? If yes, can we delete or merge?
6. **Cost:** Is it disproportionately slow? Can we use Mox / a unit boundary instead?

## Automated “Smell” Checks (always on)

These should converge to **zero occurrences**:
- `Process.sleep/1` or `:timer.sleep/1` in tests.
- Global config mutation in tests (`Application.put_env/delete_env`) where a process-local override would do.
- Tests with no meaningful assertions (`assert true`, “smoke tests” without verifying effects).
- Flaky waiting patterns (polling, sleeping) instead of deterministic synchronization.

## Workflow

1. **Inventory & metrics**
   - Count tests per file; locate the heaviest/slowest files.
   - Use `mix test --cover` to find low-coverage modules that matter.
2. **Mechanical cleanup**
   - Replace sleeps with deterministic state manipulation or process synchronization.
   - Introduce/configure a process-local runtime config override (so tests can stay async).
3. **Semantic review**
   - Go file-by-file, tagging each as:
     - ✅ keep
     - 🛠 refactor (brittle/slow)
     - 🧪 add coverage (missing cases)
     - 🗑 remove (redundant / nonsensical)
4. **Guardrails**
   - Prefer boundaries + Mox for “future” behaviors.
   - Keep commits small and semantically scoped (one refactor or one coverage area per commit).
