# Fediverse sample fixtures

These JSON fixtures are copied from `../fediverse-samples/samples/activity/` (a set of
ActivityPub sample payloads generated for testing instances, e.g. `fedifun.dev`).

They are used by compatibility/ingestion tests to ensure we can accept/reject common
payload variants found in the wild.
